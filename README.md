# Mark Calculator

## Instructions:
After cloning the repository, run `python3 main.py` or `python main.py` in your terminal. 
Make sure you have python (python3) installed. If not, try running `pip install python3`

The program runs completely in the terminal, and it will ask you to setup the list of categories and their respective percentages (weights).
An example of this is:
> Knowledge: 20%, Application: 20%, Thinking: 20%, Communication: 10%, Exams: 30%.

Following the setup, you will have a couple of options. 
1. Add an entry
2. Remove an entry
3. Reset all data
4. Mark report
5. View categories

Please note that all data will be stored in **data.json**, so all changes will be saved even when you rerun the program.
